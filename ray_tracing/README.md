Do some ray tracing, and print out relevant variables (receive and launch angles, attenuation, etc.)

first activate environment: `source ../env.sh`

then compile: `make -f ../Makefile doRayTrace`

then run: `./doRayTrace`

symlink to the AraSim data directory (here from cvmfs) is needed in order for the instantiation of the IceModel to work
